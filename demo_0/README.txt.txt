 -- Demo Instructions --

1. Navigate to the folder 'main/data/'

   You will notice six files:
      'sample0.pdf'
      'sample1.pdf'
      'sample2.pdf'

   The sample pdfs are transcripts that have been provided to me.


2. In a new window navigate to the folder 'main/csv_out'
   When you run the demo, the output csv will be written to this folder.


3. Run the executable 'main.exe' located in the 'main' folder.
   
   This will scrape 'sample0.pdf'.

   If you would like to run the demo on another file, rename the target
   file to 'sample0.pdf'. You will notice that the processing time is
   dependent entirely on the length of the transcript.

   DO NOT feed corrupted, invalid, or non-transcript PDFs into the demo
   program. The demo does not have safety features to handle these exceptions
   and may freeze or crash if you do so.
